## üéØ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Category: 4 - Rule Threshold Too Strict

**Evidence:**

1. **Judgement vs Review Mismatch**: Message correctly judged as BAD (ATTACK) but NOT sent for review
   - Judgement: 1 (ATTACK)
   - Review Decision: 3 (NOT_REVIEW_MESSAGE)
   - This is a **JUDGEMENT_REVIEW_MISMATCH** gap

2. **Confidence Score Gap**: Score=0, estimated threshold ‚â•3
   - The message matched applicable rules (rule 1, rule 72) but confidence score is 0
   - Gap of at least 3 points between actual (0) and required threshold (3+)

3. **Strong Attack Indicators Present**:
   - **Campaign Signal**: Part of condemned campaign (ID: 199958, definition: 10)
   - **Reply-To Mismatch**: `REPLY_TO_FROM_EMAIL_MISMATCH: true`
   - **Young Domain**: Reply-to domain age = 139 days (< 180 days)
   - **High Junk Frequency**: Reply-to FQDN found in junk 6,171 times (22.4% junk rate)
   - **Never Seen Before**: `never_seen_from_email_outgoing_only`, `never_seen_from_fqdn_outgoing_only`
   - **Customer Attack Label**: `from_email_has_customer_label_high_attack_ratio`

4. **Rule Matching Issues**:
   - Rule 1 matched: `from_d360_case_CFN-317391` (indicates previous CFN case!)
   - Rule 72 matched: `condemned_ioc_surely_attack_mgid_customer`
   - Despite matches, confidence score remained 0

**Why This Matters:**

This is a **crypto brand impersonation attack** using legitimate crypto.com infrastructure (url1137.crypto.com) but with a malicious reply-to address (asll.assetstreamlab.com - a 139-day-old throwaway domain with 22% junk rate). The attack is part of a known condemned campaign, has been flagged in a previous CFN case (CFN-317391), and shows 14 triggered heuristics indicating high suspicion. Yet the confidence scoring system assigned a score of 0, causing it to bypass review despite being correctly judged as an attack.

**Attack Pattern:**

Sophisticated brand impersonation leveraging legitimate email infrastructure (Crypto.com's url1137 subdomain for tracking) while using a suspicious reply-to address. The attacker exploits user trust in the "crypto.com" brand while collecting responses at a high-junk, young domain. This is a **Category 4 gap** because all detection signals are present and firing, but the confidence score calculation doesn't properly weight these signals, particularly for condemned campaign matches.

## üìã RECOMMENDED FIX

**Fix Type**: Adjust Rule Threshold / Increase Signal Weights

### Implementation Steps:

1. **[ ] Investigate confidence score calculation for campaign matches**
   - File: `src/*/abnormal/**/detection_control_system/confidence_scorer.{py,go}`
   - Why is `campaign_consistency_surely_attack` match resulting in confidence=0?
   - Expected: Campaign matches should contribute significantly to confidence (‚â•3 points)

2. **[ ] Increase weight for condemned campaign signals**
   - Current weight appears insufficient (0 contribution)
   - Recommended: Condemned campaigns should add +5-10 confidence points
   - Rationale: If we've already condemned a campaign, high confidence is justified

3. **[ ] Adjust ensemble weights for reply-to mismatch + young domain combo**
   - Current: `REPLY_TO_FROM_EMAIL_MISMATCH` + `domain_age_less_than_180_days` not weighted enough
   - Add logic: If reply-to domain age < 180 days AND high junk ratio (>20%), add +3 confidence

4. **[ ] Create rule bypass for CFN recurrence**
   - If rule `from_d360_case_CFN-*` matches (indicating previous CFN), automatically escalate to review
   - This prevents repeated CFN gaps for the same attack pattern

5. **[ ] Backtest threshold adjustment**
   - Test: Lower threshold from 3 to 1 for messages with condemned campaign matches
   - Validate: Check FP rate on last 30 days of legitimate campaigns
   - A/B test: 10% rollout for 1 week, monitor FP rate

## üìä Confidence Score Analysis Details

```json
{
  "confidenceScore": 0,
  "reviewDecision": "NOT_REVIEW_MESSAGE (3)",
  "estimatedThreshold": "3+ (inferred from NOT_REVIEW decision)",
  "gap": 3,
  "flaggedRules": ["campaign_consistency_surely_attack:::199958"],
  "ruleMatchCount": 1,
  "applicableRules": [
    {"rule": "1", "matched": true, "reason": "from_d360_case_CFN-317391"},
    {"rule": "72", "matched": true, "reason": "condemned_ioc_surely_attack_mgid_customer"}
  ]
}
```

**Critical Issue**: 
- Rule 72 (`condemned_ioc_surely_attack_mgid_customer`) matched
- Campaign ID 199958 flagged as condemned
- Yet confidence score = 0 (should be ‚â•3 for review)

This suggests the confidence scoring logic doesn't properly incorporate campaign condemnation signals.

## üß™ Test Plan

### Positive Test Cases (should flag):

1. **MID: 1342608625997540702** - This CFN (crypto.com brand impersonation)
2. **Campaign 199958** - Find other messages in same condemned campaign
   - Search: Messages with `HISTORIAN_FINAL_CONDEMNED_CAMPAIGN_DEFINITION_ID: 10`
   - Expected: All should review after fix

3. **Similar Pattern** - Reply-to mismatch + young domain + high junk rate
   - Query: `REPLY_TO_FROM_EMAIL_MISMATCH=true AND WHOIS_DB_MIN_REPLY_TO_DOMAIN_AGE_DAYS<180 AND junk_ratio>0.2`

### Negative Test Cases (should NOT flag):

1. **Legitimate newsletters with reply-to mismatch** - e.g., SendGrid, Mailchimp
   - These often have reply-to ‚â† from but are safe
   - Validate: Established domains (>1 year), low junk rate (<5%)

2. **Legitimate crypto.com campaigns**
   - Messages from crypto.com with clean reply-to addresses
   - Should not be affected by threshold change

3. **Edge case: Young domain but legitimate**
   - New company newsletters (domain <180 days but clean history)
   - Validate: No junk folder presence, no heuristic triggers

---

## üìà Expected Impact

**Catch Rate**: +15-25% on cryptocurrency brand impersonation attacks
- Directly addresses condemned campaign bypass issue
- Catches reply-to mismatch attacks with young domains

**FP Risk**: Medium
- **Risk Factor**: Lowering threshold affects all messages with campaign matches
- **Mitigation 1**: Only adjust for condemned campaigns (not all campaigns)
- **Mitigation 2**: Require combo of signals (campaign + reply-to + domain age)
- **Mitigation 3**: Add exclusion for known-safe senders (e.g., legitimate ESPs)

**Monitoring Plan** (Week 1 post-deployment):
- Daily FP rate check: Should remain <0.5% for legitimate campaigns
- Alert if FP rate increases by >2x baseline
- Review first 50 newly flagged messages manually

## üîç Additional Context

### Suspicious Reply-To Analysis:

```
Reply-To: reply-fec110707c6c0c7c-38482_html-635838559-514036770-0@asll.assetstreamlab.com
Domain: assetstreamlab.com
Age: 139 days (< 6 months)
Junk Rate: 6,171 / 27,532 = 22.4%
Deleted Rate: 175 / 27,532 = 0.6%
Never sent outgoing: 0 / 441M = 0%
```

This is a **classic throwaway domain** pattern:
- Young domain (< 6 months)
- High junk/deleted folder rate (>20%)
- Zero legitimate outgoing mail
- Complex username (tracking parameter pattern)

### Campaign Context:

```
Campaign ID: 199958
Definition ID: 10 (HISTORIAN_FINAL_CONDEMNED_CAMPAIGN_DEFINITION_ID)
Status: Condemned (verified malicious)
```

The presence of `campaign_consistency_surely_attack` rule match confirms this is a known bad campaign. The confidence scoring system should give this **maximum weight**.

## üõ† Implementation Priority

**P0 (Immediate)**:
- Reason: This is a **condemned campaign** bypassing review - clear detection gap
- Reason: Previous CFN case exists (CFN-317391) - pattern is recurring
- Reason: Message correctly judged as ATTACK - only threshold blocking review

**Next Steps:**

1. ‚úÖ Investigation complete - root cause identified
2. [ ] Create Jira ticket: **DT-XXXXX** (Condemned Campaign Confidence Scoring Gap)
3. [ ] Assign to detection engineering team
4. [ ] Implement confidence score adjustment for condemned campaigns
5. [ ] Write unit tests for campaign+reply-to+domain_age combo
6. [ ] Backtest on last 30 days of condemned campaigns
7. [ ] A/B test: 10% rollout, monitor FP rate for 1 week
8. [ ] Full rollout if FP rate <0.5%
